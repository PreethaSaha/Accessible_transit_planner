# Accessible_transit_planner
Accessible Transit Planner is a Python tool designed to help users find the most accessible paths through Chicago's CTA 'L' train system. It can be extended for other transit services like Metra.
It incorporates:

- Real-time service alerts(like elevator outages)

- Station accessibility data

- Color-coded route mapping

- Duplicate/shared station handling
to plan the most efficient, disability-friendly routes across the city.
